# Analytics

This is a web application which allows user to upload an excel/csv file containing api logs data and
produces data visualisations + summary statistics.
The app is based on Dash framework which uses JS plotly as visualisation engine. It allows user to interact with charts by filtering them,
changing the scale etc.

The goal of visualisation and statistical analysis is to identify the number of unsuccessful user authorizations, failed sessions
and other api-related metrics by hours/days in order to identify reoccurring problems which need to be addressed.
